What is this project?
This is a php script that will act as a file library for the XO Server (XS).
The goal of this script is to build sever that will act as the back end
for an application on the XO PCs that will allow a central file library.

This project's original motivation was to build a library back end for the XS
to allow easy download of e-books on the XOs in a school setting.

Dependencies:
  * A recent copy of the codeigniter framework: http://codeigniter.com/
  	* There may be an error with the sql system at in the "1.7.2" version
  	  If you see any weird probelms or errors with the search system
  	  then see this post: http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/129041/
  	  for the fix
  	  
  * Apache/httpd server with sql and php support

Installation:
   * Get source files, the src folder will be the web root.
       In my setup, I renamed the src folder to www and put it in
       /var/www/xs-filedistro/
   * Configure webserver to point to the src directory as the
     root directory
   * Download a copy of the codeigniter framework.
   * Unzip the file and copy the system folder to be one directory above
     the src directory (if placed somewhere else then edit system path
     variable the index.php in the src directory)
       In my setup, it was placed in the /var/www/xs-filedistro/ folder.
       So that the folder had both www and system.
   * Create database user (remember to update the database.db in the
     application/config folder).  Then import the tables. The sql dump included
     is for mysql and one for postgres.
     In a future release, I plan on writing an installer to automate this.
       One note: Make sure permissions are set correctly in postgres for the db user.
   * Update the config.php, database.php, and settings.php files in the application/config folder.
