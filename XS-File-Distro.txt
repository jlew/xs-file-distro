What is this project?
This is a php script that will act as a file library for the XO Server (XS).
The goal of this script is to build sever that will act as the back end
for an application on the XO PCs that will allow a central file library.

This project's original motivation was to build a library back end for the XS
to allow easy download of e-books on the XOs in a school setting.

Dependencies:
  * A recent copy of the codeigniter framework: http://codeigniter.com/
  * Apache/httpd server with sql and php support

Installation:
   * Get source files, the src folder will be the web root.
       In my setup, I renamed the src folder to www and put it in
       /var/www/xs-filedistro/
   * Configure webserver to point to the src directory as the
     root directory
   * Download a copy of the codeigniter framework.
   * Unzip the file and copy the system folder to be one directory above
     the src directory (if placed somewhere else then edit system path
     variable the index.php in the src directory)
       In my setup, it was placed in the /var/www/xs-filedistro/ folder.
       So that the folder had both www and system.
   * Create database user (remember to update the database.db in the
     application/config folder).  Then import the tables. The sql dump included
     is for mysql, if you are using postgresql, at this time you need to
     manually modify it. (like change int() to pure integers, remove any ` marks,
     remove auto_increment and replace the integers for auto increment to serial.)
     In a future release, I plan on writing an installer to automate this.
       One note: Make sure permissions are set correctly in postgres for the db user.
   * Update the config.php file in the application/config folder.
