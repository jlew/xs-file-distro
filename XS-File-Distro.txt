What is this project?
This is a php script that will act as a file library for the XO Server (XS).
The goal of this script is to build sever that will act as the back end
for an application on the XO PCs that will allow a central file library.

This project's original motivation was to build a library back end for the XS
to allow easy download of e-books on the XOs in a school setting.
